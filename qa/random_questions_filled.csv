903725333595947059,"Was listening to the twitter spaces for 89 and had a thought. There was mention of this dynamic where the majority of auction bids occur right before noun o'clock. I have a feeling that this is a function of the fact that nouns uses a single price, public bid auction. There has been a lot of research into auctions that should produce superior results (defining superior as better price discovery). 

Has anyone thought about researching / potentially integrating a different auction method (ex: generalized second price auction,VCG auction, etc. ) ?",1,

1047017382419382363,"Looking for some feedback on this DAO. 

Idea is a network state based on collecting/curation and scholarship around xcopy (I know, but hear me out) 

I can‚Äôt work about a better name than xcopyology, xcopystan, xcopy land or something like that

Xcopy has a tumblr archive dating back 12 years containing 1200 works or thereabouts. It‚Äôs a great resource that documents his development and process and obviously as a collector I look at it an go, well what if tumblr died, how can this be preserved? 

To build an on chain record of this work is the aim (and remembering xcopy work is cc0) 

So I have downloaded all the works chronologically. The files are webp but I have gifs and png files also. Most of the works are between 4 and 8 frames for the webp. 

Was thinking a daily auction of each work, which is original xcopy first brought onchain, and therefore valuable as a 1/1, then using the funds to buy onchain xcopy works and create an atlas/compendium and scholarly curation work on mirror. 

At the end of the auction period all the collected works would be donated to a museum that agrees to show the work in public 

Q: it will work better if the uploaded files are gif or webp. Any way to do that? 
Q: obvs the files are just one layer but I wonder about layering each frame of the 8 frames into groups for each work. Not sure I can do that 
Q: the files are a fraction under 600 pixels, so I have to resize all 1200 unless nouns.build can be tweaked to allow smaller file sizes?

Anything clever unique or cool but with an emphasis on MEMETIC POTENCY and VIRALITY.  i'd provide examples - golfys gif, memes, physical art, open to other suggestions.  

We'd give 1 ETH to the 3 best and 70+ awards of 0.1 ETH to anything we thought was cool.  it might be worth considering using a L2 for this because of the amount of transactions involved.  The only rules would be no harassment and no vandalism.  I think this could whip twitter into an absolute frenzy.  However, my one concern is that it may be too open ended.  The coloring contest was very successful but it had a much more specific focus.  This would also serve as a trial run for us to work out the kinks before a much, much bigger 2nd run after the super bowl commercial airs

the way i think it'd structure it now would be people quote-retweeting my post for virality and maybe including their ETH address in their tweet.  any kind of tooling to make this easier would be great.  we could assemble a panel of judges for the 3 best and then just spray smaller rewards everywhere somewhat more arbitrarily

It just so happened to bring the prototype with me on my little excursion to Mexico. When I came across Nouns I got fucking hyped and pulled out ol√© faithful.

I still need to finish the SDS, but almost everything is already laid out in my noggin. 

I am having a hard time connecting it with the noun esthetic, BUTTT the purpose of the game is use real world scenarios to teach people the basic personal finance and investment skills that school just so happened to bypass. I am hoping with this game I could help people free themselves from the cyclic path of financial struggle. To me that's pretty dang nounish.

Would love to collab with some others to help me with the coding and final design.

Documentation can be found at https://docs.deathwish1.com/ (with links to dapp and audit)

I'm writing for access to Nouns DAO funding for this unique use case as well as to encourage Noun holders to use Death Wish to secure their Nouns. I would also appreciate any Tweets in support of my project.

Thanks for reading!",1,

We should set a regular cadence of meetings (once a week)

4156‚Äôs blog post: Do good in the real world. A chance to make positive change + generate income and inquiry and positive publicity improving the brand value.

Skatepark: It has been great to see so many people putting their hands up and stepping forward to connect us or get involved.

Start with high impact projects: If one is successful we‚Äôll end up with heaps of people/organisations coming at us for nouns to get involved.

How will proposals scale as we grow? Its exciting to imagine what scope of projects will come. 

Donations/contributions that get us to name something is an interesting avenue. 

Skatepark.org accept crypto (awesome!) Do we need a bank account or some sort of real ‚Äútraditional‚Äù world interface to pay for these kind of projects generally? Working on something here.

Incentivising proposal submissions: A pool of money is an incentive itself. Eventually we will be trying to disincentivizing it once it takes off.

Ideally we want noun owners to want to push nouns forward and be active participants, obviously free-rider problem will always exist but could building incentives help and be important? 
-Do we have rewards for voting? 
-Stipends for quality proposal? Incentivise bringing interesting people and ideas to the dao
-Feels too early for above. That should be last resort. Social levers are really powerful.

Coming soon is nouns profile pages! Vote history etc. which will hopefully begin incentivising on a social layer
-Perhaps POAPs and badges for participation will come.

SharkDAO struggling with their own level of participation in voting and proposals etc. One method being used is to try to improve information flow, this could be something nounsDAO should consider.

Should NounsDAO hire some people? There are folks in community interested in working full time as either contractors or employees or residents‚Ä¶ what do we think about that? Scale up resources? Ideas for community management, designer, full stack dev‚Ä¶

A) Divide the extra amount equally among all eligible Nouncillors (they must update their Proposals accordingly, or refuse the additional ETH.) 
Pros: Quickness, since we need to execute and report back on these initiatives by end of July. 
Cons: No broader participation, no new ideas. 

B) Ask all Nouncillors who would have been eligible for next round (joined one month too late for eligibility this round) to submit ideas, award top 6 ideas 1 ETH each from remainder. 
Pros: Broader participation, new ideas. 
Cons: Adds 1-2 weeks to administration time, execution timing will be difficult. 

C) Return funds to DAO. 
Pros: Minimal additional work required to administer. 
Cons: Potential optics around appearing as though we cannot deploy capital to good use for proliferation within our networks/communities.

Nounishness is very difficult to define. I did a word study on ‚Äòbeauty‚Äô a while ago, which is also quite difficult to define. In my searching, I found this definition by Jonathan King which I thought hit the nail on the head.

> *Beauty is an intrinsic quality of things which, when it‚Äôs perceived, pleases the mind by a certain kind of fittingness.*

I thought that was a good place to start for describing what Nounish means, which I think is just a certain beauty that is exclusive to Nouns. 

Nounish is an intrinsic quality of things which, when it‚Äôs perceived, pleases the mind by a certain kind of fittingness to the Nouns community. It can be used to describe physical or digital objects and general values.  
*1.    In regards to art: ‚ÄúThat new derivative project looks very Nounish.‚Äù
2.    In regards to physical goods: ‚ÄúEven though it doesn‚Äôt include noggles, this still feels very Nounish to me‚Äù

But TLDR for now: Gnars consumes about same gas per auction as Nouns but generally sell for 1/1000th of the price atm. Back to back auctions mean about 8 per day max. 

When gas prices are high this can be quite a lot for a single entity to fund (once precedent is set probably no going back). So for now the emission rate is a product of demand and considering how early we are (less than 2 months) it‚Äôs going pretty well (yet to promote much also). 

At the moment, probably constitutes a UX problem more than an economics problem, so thanks again for the feedback. Since many of these parameters can be changed, i will explore options and as a community we can decide. 

Despite being gnarly, we can take our time and feel it out, make data driven decisions etc. Will be good fun. I think for now, directing newcomers who are met with an unsettled auction to our discord, so we can answer questions is probably a good start. üôè",1,

1092471872714706974,"**1. Do you have any information about how much other teams are sponsored for?  By who and what they get in return? Some comparable data**

Yes! I have some comparable data on how much other esports teams are sponsored for and what they receive in return. Let's start with Dota as an example. Our team is currently ranked 3rd out of the 16 teams that compete in the Pro Circuit in North America, and we are proposing to pay our players up to $4000 per month.

In comparison, the two teams ranked above us in Dota are Shopify Rebellion and TSM. Shopify Rebellion players, historically one of the most dominant NA teams, are making around $20,000 per month. TSM brought in a new squad consisting of international players from regions across the world and receive between $5000 to $7000 per month.

In South America, the top two teams that we've competed against historically receive $9000 and $12,000 per month, respectively.

In the CS:GO vertical, our players are also receiving up to $4000 per month. The most dominant teams in North America are Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses. Team Liquid is one of the best teams internationally and has a long history in esports. While every player on their team likely makes six figures of salary, star players on independent contracts likely earn upwards of $20-30k per month. Generally speaking all the top teams are making six-figures of salary.

Evil Geniuses is running a unique program in CS:GO with a ""main"" roster and two training squads, ""White"" and ""Black."" Their training rosters earn $5000 per month, while their main roster likely earns double that.

In both game verticals we believe we've identified and are working with teams that fit in a sweet spot of skill, player notoriety, and cost.

So what do these esports orgs get in return?  Attention. They are brands that sell content and association with their content. In Shopify Rebellion's case, they have no additional sponsors, but in the case of teams like Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses, esports native brands, they have a sleeve full of sponsors who pay to be a part of the team's journey.",1,

when we look at nouns esports, we have that label as an overarching title but it encompasses multiple people making different proposals for various games/players/activations ect. there is a discord where anyone can join and look to contribute, nouns esport socials will support future other esports prop builders/games ect.

Inflow of new talent (which see valid opportunities) vs opportunist (which is the phase we are currently in) is what then spurges the longer trend after the initial bubble popped, as they have a long term view and continue building in this space.

We chatted about the how a catastrophic tragedy on the news struck Sola like a brick to the head, and how he veered onto the path of making positive changes in the world. Where does Sola see UNouns in 100 years, how can web3 assist charity organisations and what will be the ultimate goal for UNouns? You will have to listen to the recording below to find out.

Even at ~100 ETH a day, we're bringing in ~600 ETH ($2.7M) a week. What are we spending a week? I don't know exactly, but something very very little in comparison. As an experimental, early project, why are we so interested in stockpiling ETH? To prepare for a winter? Because we are worried the nouns auction price would drop in the future and this is all we'll ever have? I think the only reason such a drought of buyers would occur (maybe we're starting to see it now) is if this group fails to demonstrate that it can spend the treasury in an inspiring way. The first set of buyers (~100 of us so far) were people that were just excited about the set of primitives (daily auction + treasury + governance) and were willing to fill in the blank space about what this could be. I think there's a limit to that pure-imagination crowd. The next set of buyers need to be inspired by what we do with the ETH we have.

1013370672451436544,"The classic risotto preparation requires almost an hour of constant attention and stirring over a hot
stove. But microwave risotto takes only 3 minutes of preparation and 18 minutes of unattended
cooking, so I am willing to make it even for myself of a quick lunch.
Barbara Kafka discovered that risotto could be made in the microwave. I have modified Kafka s
original recipe slightly to make this fine, astonishingly easy risotto.
INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon fruity olive oil
3 shallots, finely chopped
1 large garlic clove, finely chopped
1 cup Arborio rice
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 cup dry sherry
4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
PREPARATION
1. Stir together the oil, garlic and rice in a medium microwavable bowl, and microwave on HIGH,
uncovered, for 3 minutes 2. Mix in the broth and the sherry, cover, and microwave on HIGH for 18
minutes. Stir to see if broth is absorbed and risotto is creamy. If not, microwave for another 2 to5
minutes, then stir in the Parmesan cheese and serve. Variation: Mushroom and Tomato Risotto While
the Risotto is cooking for 18 minutes in the microwave, I often like to prepare the following
condimenti, which I add to the risotto at the same time I add the Parmesan cheese. 2 tablespoons
unsalted butter 8 ounces sliced white mushrooms (about 2 cups) or 4 ounces shiitake mushrooms 3
small tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped 1/2 cup fresh or defrosted frozen peas 1. Heat the butter
in a small skillet over moderate heat. When it begins to foam, add the mushrooms and tomatoes and
gently saut√©, stirring occasionally for about 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and the liquid
from the tomatoes has almost evaporated. Add salt and pepper to taste. Turn off heat and set aside. 2.
After approximately 18 minutes, when the rice is tender by still firm, add the condimenti, and stir
vigorously to combine with the rice. Serve immediately.",,

There's no central place for proposal owners to update the DAO and we don't suggest that they do. 1) There needs to be a tool for easy communication between funded proposers and DAO members and 2) the DAO needs to suggest that proposers update if they are funded.

Here is my response from Twitter as well

> I think the DAO should suggest that builders give updates if they are funded. This is not an unreasonable request. This suggestion could be made during the proposal flow. Not a definitive rule, but a suggestion that conveys the message ""We have this tool and you should use it because we love updates and enjoy seeing your progress"". I'm not aware of any suggestions of how a proposal owner might update the DAO, or actions they should take after they are funded. 

> Without a central discord, Noun communication is fragmented. How does a proposal owner know where to post updates? There should be guidelines around accountability once funded and we should provide a place for builders to give updates to the DAO.",,

‚Ä¶ but overall, this looks fine to me.  SharkDAO is very distributed (and I support the movement to more programmatic voting by sub-DAOs).  The Nounders multisig is distributed, so the trend of ownership distribution does not feel problematic unless a whale goes on a consistent buying spree.  I‚Äôve heard some argue that the current avg. NOUN price prohibits that, but I think it‚Äôs a potential risk.

I believe the intention of the Nounders was to prevent any single owner or sub-DAO from acquiring too much control in the project.  Curious as to what controls (other than the Nounders‚Äô veto) can prevent that? Any idea I have come up with feels overly restrictive.",,

**Toadz Acquisition Proposal**
- https://nouns.wtf/vote/55
- Dont think this should go through with NAC
- What do people think of acquiring toadz?
    - Something to be said of signaling other collections/communities
    - What would we do with them?
- I think there are more productive ways to help other projects
- Does just buying send that big of a signal? Display them anywhere?
    - If it‚Äôs just sending a signal, we can do so with only buying 1 of a collection
- There is already so much to focus on with Nouns

**NFT Purpose Blockchain**
- https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/create-the-first-purpose-built-nft-blockchain-run-by-nft-projects/965
- 2 Nouners on team
- Potential Use Cases: Noun lore social feed and fight club
- Nouns would be a first/main NFT projects to be used on this (Fight Club Game)
- Who is the team?
    - Brennen.eth
    - Honkdiddly
    - Evan
- Is the 125E is a strategic relationship with Nouns?
    - Potential VCs looking for DAO partnership/capital
- Semi-permissioned blockchain
- Has this team built other blockchains/NFT platforms before?
    - Not exactly, but have been in space for awhile working other technical projects
- Could mitigate concerns of having to interact with your NFT
- Why not come to the DAO at a later stage when the product is built & proven?
- We should think of this as ‚Äúwould be use the utility on top‚Äù as they want to build either way
- May need a deeper dive on the actual use cases for nouns as opposed to blockchain tech details

**Beer Garden**
- https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-sponsor-charity-beer-garden-and-establish-str-housing-for-local-childrens-hospital-families/787/17
- Likely no bud partnership as of now
- Exploring other potential Sponsorships with beverage companies
- If another national beverage company wanted to become part of the DAO, how does that impact relationship w Bud?
    - Seems valuable to have competitors, but would ideally bring in other partners before another beer company
    - Nothing stopping anyone or any company from buying a noun and joining the DAO",,

We want to create a customizable homepage for Nouns where you can insert the data that you want to see the most. Data hungry? Put up historical charts, treasury info, proposed transactions, and rarity scores. Builder? Put up prop information, load in your favorite project updates, newsletter, and a custom twitter feed. Social? Load in fomo, auction trackers, noun o'clock, and the general discord. Maybe you'll create different pages for different times of the day and switch between them when you want to. That's the long-term goal.

Most of all, we want to make this a platform that can be built upon. When new projects start and exciting updates happen, we want those groups to be able to plug in and build their own panels to add to the platform so it can change and grow as the DAO does. It's a big vision, but if we can create the foundation and a few panels to start, I believe it will be incredibly useful to the community for a long time in the future.",,

994689839146467359,"hey all. prop house's first 25 ETH round closed its proposal window with 51 proposals yesterday. the voting window is now open for all nouners to cast their votes. please take the time out to do so! it's v encouraging for new builders: https://prop.house/nouns-combinator

i shared some of my favorites here: https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca/status/1545129129007349760

some initial thoughts on this round:
- there's a LOT of builder interest. 51 proposals = ~100 people that took the time out to think through, consider and submit their proposals.
- there's an obvious need for better formatting. rich media is prob a solution or maybe a dedicated team to look through props? going through 51 proposals is just not feasible for nouners (i just did it üíÄ)
- i am increasingly convinced that prop house is an onboarding portal more than a prop portal. ie GREAT props will come through formal proposals but many of those builders may first come through prop house. maybe framing it as a loss leader makes sense? 
- i have a sense that big rounds with specific mandates will do better than big ""open"" rounds in terms of quality (as opposed to volume)",,

1072249730006003752,"gm @here -- I wanted to proactively share some answers to frequent questions we‚Äôve been getting:

**Aren‚Äôt you VC-backed?**
Yes, we are. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve geared this prop to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase ‚Äî so there is no centralized value capture, and anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the end deliverables. We think this completely aligns incentives and will help  a strong, open ecosystem.

**What does open sourcing mean here?**
This means everything from the repo to the APIs will be open access, so people with varying levels of technical acumen can clone and re-host and build on top of House of Nouns. We‚Äôll also be doing continual data dumps to Arweave for any offchain data.

**Budget?**
While ETH is going up in price, we‚Äôve decreased our prop‚Äôs total cost by ~$100k. We heavily increased deliverables and the speed at which we deliver them. We‚Äôre looking for 9ETH/month/developer, which is less than any other active developers for Nouns. We think that deliverables and actual matter the most, and think they are very justifiable for the cost of 190ETH in terms of the long-term impact they can have on the DAO‚Äôs success.

**Integrations?**
We‚Äôre looking to be as open and composable as possible, and help accelerate the adoption of the infrastructure built by others in the ecosystem. Our goal is to integrate the amazing work of others everywhere it makes sense, versus create clones and replicate any functionality. We‚Äôre working on this on a case-by-case basis, but wherever infrastructure is open, we want to help accelerate its adoption instead of competing with it.",,

4. Nouns x Dog Shelter Toy Donation
  I love this dog toys. I would love to see more photos of pets playing with nounish toys.
5. Nounify Digital Inclusion
  It is an interesting way to support low income families with refurbished computers. It is definitely a proposal that would help many people. During my undergraduate, I taught computer class to children on old refurbished computers.

1. Nouns Wall Mural(s) in Singapore

Now we're expanding it to be more discovery oriented, somewhere where you can still keep track of your multiple DAOs in a single dashboard, but moreso where you can also discover new DAOs and communities to become a part of.

I do think you are genuinely trying to build a nounish media company BUT at the same time I do not think that it is working nor will it work or can bring value anywhere near what is being spent under the current model or the one proposed in the prop. 

Nouns has clearly made a lot of investments that have not brought value > the price paid over the past near 2 years. The market is telling us this very clearly. TNS imo is one of these things. 

At a cost of over $1m p/year - I dont think its possible. If you gave the metrics and the amount spent to anyone outside of Nouns and asked them is this a good use of funds? Have we received or will we receive good value from this investment? I would say that the answer would No. We are off by an order of magnitude here in terms of the price we are paying for the value we are getting. 

Maybe we do put this out there and ask what others think on Twitter or somewhere from a more objective POV?

Nouns DAO has funded a project with 1000ETH to basically help people easily build Nounish communities. So this is part of the culture of Nouns and most people here are part of multiple communities within the Nouns ecosystem, that's why we call it an ecosystem.

 
**My vision for this specialized community is to be a red carpet entry into Nouns DAO itself.** So if you dream of owning a Noun and benefitting from the awesome possibilities that come with that, the community we're building here will specialize in providing tools that will help make that dream a reality.

For example somebody mentioned Nouns to Nouns lending here, I've personally always found it kinda strange that there is no Nounish DeFi solution that helps people get a seat at the table.

I'm sure that you'll agree that those seats are pretty expensive and lots of people would love any help they could get getting one of those.

And that help is exactly what I'll be providing through what I'm building on top of TIN.


Almost all of the onboarding in this ecosystem is focused on providing information, there is no onboarding solution that actually FUNDS people to be an actual holder of Nouns, and therefore have a full seat at the table.

Take the prop House round for example that Toady has been so graceful in putting together despite some initial lack of appreciation of what that represents: though submitting ideas in the round is definitely a great way to get started in the Nouns ecosystem, the ideal and exciting endgame would be to be a voter who actually has a full say on how treasury funds are allocated.

That's exciting and that, in my humble opinion, is the major win we're all ultimately shooting for.

We need more Nouns holders with a variety of viewpoints: the fact that the Nounsvitational prop did not pass was a MAJOR wake up call to me.

**Xanadu x Nouns** 
- https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/xanadu-x-nouns-mega-episode-real-time-nouns-world-toolkit/2156/3
- 2 parts of the prop:
    - 3D toolkit for future creators - CC0 assets
    - an episode of Xanadu with Nouns
        - would be great to attach ourselves to such new tech and interesting work
        - Nouns infiltration of Youtube
- they seem genuinely excited, one of the best proposals (form) so far
- interviewed on Noun O Clock - https://youtu.be/M7F1G4y--Qg

**Regional Colors by Messhup**
- https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-regional-colors/1941/10
- website design part seems expensive
- maybe some scaled-down version with 1 language funded via NSFW first

**Roko Update**
- Roko can now summarise voice calls
- more stuff coming soon, testing is underway

**NounsDAO Brazil**
- NounsBrazil week is still a few weeks out
- recently redesigned skatepark in Rio, Bob Burnquist attended the event
- Twitter spaces starting next week

**Prop House**
- in talks with big communities
- becoming open-sourced very soon, also opening up  API
- big UI revamp coming soon as well
- governance-focused mandate round ending soon

**Funding Big Proposals**
- large bets need large conviction
- spending a higher % of treasury on proposals without huge ROI doesn't make sense at this point in time
- focus on attracting more people who are able to directly contribute to the DAO

**IRL activities**
- Nouns should be more active at IRL events
- Devcon coming up - Honk, Brennen, elad and some others are coming
    - bringing some nounish goods? merch?
- would be nice to have a list of people willing to fill in IRL roles (showing up to events, being interviewed, etc)
    - maybe we could use Prop House for this
- reviving events committee?
    - prop house mandate round for events?
- more treasure hunts?",,

Scanning through the recent Monorepo forks (paste in to search: https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo):
https://andremiras.github.io/gitpop3/

I see everyone's still on the packages/dependencies being phased out/deprecated.

I've been working on a major overhaul of the webapp:

4) What would be the title of a Broadway show that this Noun is lead in

5) Write this Noun's first Tweet

6) What famous sports team would this Noun play on and why

if the sound of nouns guy somehow caught fire and was getting 1 million+ views a day, we look to try and compensate with a retro impact award

if we take the community work you are doing, what is a theoretical contribution that justifies additional outsized rewards? maybe if you were directly responsible for onboarding Vitalik or Rihanna into the DAO?

The INDEX community and INDEX holders reviewed our fee structure and product construction and we came to the consensus that we would bring icETH to the market as you see it right now. 

Note, that you are paying for the risk automation and liquidation protection when holding icETH. Plus the primary keeper system AND ripcord prevent Nouns from having to actively manage the positions 24/7 while optimizing returns at the same time. Nouns will also have to corral the right people, at the right time, to huddle around a multi-sig in the event of a de-peg. It would also take 20+ individual transactions to execute this strategy so the gas costs there really add up. I think there is a significantly higher cost to performing this operation relative to the streaming fee and redeem fee we charge. I know <@827708794841727076> mentioned the possibility of doing this on your own.

**Coloring Contest**
- Splitting into physical and digital competitions
- Great engagement, looking forward to rewarding community members for their time

**Prop 30: Staking additional ~10% in Lido**
- Proposing another 1500E to be staked in Lido (in addition to our current 1500E staking)
- Emoji consensus was overwhelmingly positive in an earlier channel
- Proposed by new anon owner who has bought 5 Nouns in the past week
- Not clear on UI what is happening with the translation, hard to find ETH amount being submitted
    - Maybe a UI issue? Discussed with 9999 and vapeape briefly during the initial 1E stake
- We may want to extend the total time for on-chain proposals for sufficient time to discuss if there was no discussion prior
- Current Best practice / ideal flow would be good to have documented somewhere <a:noun_earth:923689442324144178>

**Due Diligence Committee**
- Looking for volunteers who are comfortable scanning proposed transactions to verify that they align exactly with what is being said in the proposal
- Should be intimately familiar with contracts & transactions
- On the Nounders side Solimander, Vapeape are competent and have been checking
- Would be good for the community to step up and get a bigger group involved
    - Opportunity to integrate this into proposal workflow best practice

**Other thoughts**
- For 2022, want to focus on bigger initiatives
    - While still going after small things and continuing the retro/small grants)

**Potential Action Items**
- Create proposal for increasing vote creation period to 4 days
    - With 3 days voting time makes for total of 7 days
    - If we still don‚Äôt feel this is sufficient, could look to extend from 4 to 7
- Recruitment for Due Diligence Committee",,

It took me a few conversations to understand everything going on with this team, and what they've been talking about was trying to create a documentary short about everything going on with the behind the scenes and lead-up to the event etc. But given the short timeframe and chaotic nature of the team I'm reluctant to try to pull off any sort of ambitious documentary approach from us (Nounish).

A message can only be posted once. 

I have a functioning Discord bot running in a test server. It's working perfectly with 1 user, I kinda want to up the threshold to 3 and let a few users try to break it.

To the first question:

In regards to the 5%, it's worth sharing that this number was chosen based on the benchmark that we saw in the ecosystem (5% is the same fee that partybid bills for any nouns won via group bidding e.g. noun11). Our proposal offers a better product, which is more tightly integrated with the nouns ecosystem while also collecting the 5% in fractional nouns tokens (vs partybid's up front ethereum, which worsens the bidding experience). We elected to do the 5% in noun fractions because it improved the user experience (post vs pre-bid, giving an additional 5% higher ""liklihood of winning"") and ensures the team's continued alignment with noun's long-term success by making them holders of more nouns fractions. 

We also believe that margin compression will be a race to the bottom which doesn't benefit any innovators in the ecosystem today. Partybid does a lot of work to protect that 5% margin, hence why a fork hasn't already launched and built acclaim with a lower margin. And I suspect we will also do a lot of work to protect that margin in the long term. With us open-sourcing the code on the first day, we will have to move fast to continue innovating on the product to not have that margin rapidly deteriorate. 


To the second question: 

In regards to the up front payment vs time-based compensation: I think that comp structure is acceptable, but onerous and unnecessary. I think it's worth digging deeper into why we would impose such a structure and what costs we are mitigating by doing so. We would impose the structure to mitigate losing 50% of the proposal due to a failure to deliver. But we must trade that off against a litany of other costs. These questions are rhetorical, but I think it well frames the context:

- What is the cost of moving too slowly to improve the community bidding process for nouns? Is it 10E/noun per missing community bid? 50E/noun?
- What is the cost of onerous payment structures disincentivizing contributors?
- What is the cost of the nouns ecosystem pushing away skilled contributors who are working hard to improve nouns?
- What is the cost of delaying payment and distracting a group which is executing with fast pace to achieve nouns goals?

We believe that these costs are much more significant to nouns than the failure of delivery cost, but we are happy to hear other opinions and adjust this structure if necessary. We've been working 12+ hours days for two weeks to move as fast as we can because we believe time is of the essence.",,

SubDAOs & Derivatives (aka Extensions?)**
- I think it's great if subdfaos success on their own merits
- Should we be thinking of NounsDAO<>subDAOs as country<>state? should states get funding?
- If goal is to proliferate nouns, we have so much work to do on nouns, should we be paying for people in Nouns instead of funding subDAOs?
- Whether subdaos, or deriv without some treasury going on, Noadz
- It‚Äôs a war on memes, who's gonna win? Doge has done a pretty good job on proliferating the meme
- Funding operations might not make sense, but we should re-consider how we look at subdaos to find ways to help them succeed or how to work with them
- There is fear that derivatives could detract from value, but i think people with derivs would still want the real thing
- What if Nouns are more of a platform as opposed to a product
- What if we funded every derivative instead of not trying to bless any of them?
- Im happy about sharing about something like 3D Nouns, or Noadz, where its clear people are adding thought or adding to the community
    - Don‚Äôt see as much value add with straight algorithmic transformation of the nouns
- I think people misunderstand the derivatives right now, so much appetite/so much confusion
    - Do people think that it‚Äôs valuable b/c its a derivative?
- I think derivs have to add something
- We can incentivize and inspire the types of communities/projects that we want to see

1034900065510236251,"If I may ask a question <@959005197244448848> / Having a window period where other people can apply for the eth being granted: Imo this can only work in a sector where there are a few people that have the time, and it is a part of their business plan / model to engage with those types of proposals. IE: if it's a Web3 based proposal, there are more developers out there to put a pitch forward than say a group of people that want to put a pitch together to start a Nouns Coffee brand. So certain categories will not have as much traction as others. I just put an in-depth proposal forward to start a Nouns Whisky project, it's a considerable sum of money that the DAO would have to invest. If it was open for other alcohol businesses to pitch. A) you would somehow need a group of businesses to know that there is a window period for this pitch. Who would contact these businesses? How would they know? B) Would all the businesses be on an even playing field? C) How would you determine which business is the right fit in the long run? For example the proposal that I've put together is a 10 year plan for Nouns in South Africa but starting with a 3-year project. I come from an eventing background and love all the eventing concepts that are being voted on and that have been executed. I was thinking about putting an event proposal forward to the DAO for a small 2 day festival in Cape Town, but in my mind 6 months of work to result in an event that lasts 48h isn't worth it right now. It makes more sense to start a Nouns proliferation journey with a product per se that has a lasting narrative, that can grow with the longevity of the DAO. So I chose to go with the long-term product route vs the short-term eventing proposal even though the product proposal is 5 x the ask than the eventing one. (edit) and then you need to be able to answer the tough financial questions.",,

Damn, he's been in esports since 2005 (boomer hands boyeee) <@143085903773040640> also founded wildcard as a means of being a self-sustaining group.

There are ~180M LoL players each month (great exposure). <@95704393151680512> - we're not able to afford a franchise spot in the franchise league, etc... it's a good thing to consider what are bigger plays that can be funded by the pod and what can become sustainable and a big bet (hence the two-year plan) - this is really the minimum time frame needed for something like this. <@143085903773040640> - year one is really establishing relationships, year two is really hitting the group with said partnerships, year three this thing should be sustainable and really proliferate nouns. <@95704393151680512> - we've had our first sponsorship request through nouns esports - do we want to open ourselves up to other sponsors?

I‚Äôve seen 4 unique instances of people asking if something like this existed in the last couple months. Now, I‚Äôve joked before about Nouns buying Pixel outright so you can work on this stuff forever as I love your work, and I get that you‚Äôre busy with other stuff and sadly can‚Äôt create this at the moment. He was willing to stand down at the beginning if you were going to do it but he said he spoke to you over voice chat and said it was fine or something like that? I believe there can be multiple attempts at something like this. Also, I‚Äôm in the ‚Äúcream will rise to the top‚Äù camp. I feel this way about extensions and other Nounish experiments. It‚Äôs not a crazy ask and I wanted to support a builder who‚Äôs new to Nouns. 

I don‚Äôt have a friendship with them or special connection with them, just for transparency. When they first brought this up in April I wasn‚Äôt delegated to and they got no definitive Discourse feedback one way or another. But I follow up with new builders privately all the time as I‚Äôm pretty obsessed with onboarding & builder retention. Since I‚Äôve been recently delegated some Nouns I thought supporting the creation of this very-requested type of video was worthwhile.

<@411952680244740096> starting off the call with a warm live video welcome (surprise he was wearing his red suit). 

Nobody is sharing a screen with the agenda - <@881315476163141642> falling asleep on the job!

1. <@162709914966294528> presenting https://apenoun.notion.site/Nouns-x-Dopamine-Streetwear-Capsule-a077ffd8bf234a31970e0ffad3d847f5 - this group forked nouns and would be working with them on creating streetwear with 85% of profits coming back into the treasury. <@881315476163141642> isn't familiar with 'street wear'. <@303004182129147905> curious about where the marketplace is - are we funding the creation of the marketplace and the products? Apparently the marketplace will be launching in December at art basel (event is already booked (maybe)) and we're just funding the products before the marketplace is launched.

2. <@881315476163141642> on people voting 'no' more frequently with 120, 121, and 122 all being defeated - why? Reasons:
- Poorer quality of proposals <@881315476163141642> 
- Cash grab for people trying to fund their startups <@303004182129147905> 
- Nouns now has comparables and understands how far xxx ETH can go and can reason what is / isn't worth the investment <@303004182129147905> 
- More delegation leads to fewer people really deciding the success of proposals <@270147458737242112> 

<@497119763286196225> talking about how Roko's super AI capabilities could illuminate how voting could be improved. <@362737590430072862> talking about potential incubator for props that were almost here but didn't quite make it.
<@362737590430072862> and <@881315476163141642> now talking about telling people to start with smaller asks and establishing a 'track record'.

3. https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/shark-labs-a-nounish-initiative-by-sharkdao-contributors/1870 SharkDAO requesting funding for their subDAO - <@881315476163141642> thinks that they should self-fund - loves SharkDAO and their enthusiasm, but there is a lot of overlap here with what nouns is already doing. <@245856432107290624> thinks there's a trap in this sort of thinking but isn't really providing a solution. <@362737590430072862> thinks we should always incentivize long-term flywheels. <@497119763286196225> thinks this is 'positive feedback'.

4. JokeDAO - <@881315476163141642> thinks things aren't clear, <@270147458737242112> thinks there aren't enough jokes in the proposal, maybe Roko will help with things like this. Chat is blowing up with people being confused.

5. Alternative nouns governance clients - https://nouns.wtf/vote/124 - <@791463069426384917> said something about a client that offers people clothing? <@881315476163141642> (with 16 nouns delegated to him) is now talking about bribes and such in governance clients (I think I heard drooling noises from him?)

Agenda completed at 5:08pm

VOTE FOR <@303004182129147905> SOAP https://prop.house/proposal/854

<@362737590430072862> is curious about incentivizing people to vote instead of just sitting on their nouns. <@881315476163141642> talking about social capital leading to getting funding from nouns incentivizes people to be active and thinks this isn't something that can be solved by code. <@163457318514720768>  is talking about futarchy and things. <@881315476163141642> breaking to <@163457318514720768> that the nouns aren't feeling JokeDAO.

tl;dr
```
Oni wants to make swag with dopamine
Nouners voting 'no' more
SubDAOs should plan to get to being self-funded
Nouns don't understand JokeDAO - pass on it
Noun 22 excited about alternative governance clients and potential to be bribed for voting
