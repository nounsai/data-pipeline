I have a feeling that this is a function of the fact that nouns uses a single price, public bid auction. There has been a lot of research into auctions that should produce superior results (defining superior as better price discovery). 

Has anyone thought about researching / potentially integrating a different auction method (ex: generalized second price auction,VCG auction, etc. ) ?",

1047017382419382363,"Looking for some feedback on this DAO. 

Idea is a network state based on collecting/curation and scholarship around xcopy (I know, but hear me out) 

I can‚Äôt work about a better name than xcopyology, xcopystan, xcopy land or something like that

Xcopy has a tumblr archive dating back 12 years containing 1200 works or thereabouts. It‚Äôs a great resource that documents his development and process and obviously as a collector I look at it an go, well what if tumblr died, how can this be preserved? 

To build an on chain record of this work is the aim (and remembering xcopy work is cc0) 

So I have downloaded all the works chronologically. The files are webp but I have gifs and png files also. Most of the works are between 4 and 8 frames for the webp. 

Was thinking a daily auction of each work, which is original xcopy first brought onchain, and therefore valuable as a 1/1, then using the funds to buy onchain xcopy works and create an atlas/compendium and scholarly curation work on mirror. 

At the end of the auction period all the collected works would be donated to a museum that agrees to show the work in public 

Q: it will work better if the uploaded files are gif or webp. Any way to do that? 
Q: obvs the files are just one layer but I wonder about layering each frame of the 8 frames into groups for each work. Not sure I can do that 
Q: the files are a fraction under 600 pixels, so I have to resize all 1200 unless nouns.build can be tweaked to allow smaller file sizes? 

Thoughts?",

Prop 36: Nouns Outdoor Advertising Placement On Giant Donut Statue In Los Angeles (Randy‚Äôs Donuts)**
- https://nouns.wtf/vote/36](https://nouns.wtf/vote/36
- What‚Äôs our appetite for budget on other large physicals?
    - I was looking at installations in brooklyn ect for other projects
- Will we be able to start zero‚Äôing in on more precise ways of measuring cost vs. benefit for something like this? Hard to figure out KPIs
- Can we set up a fun incentive for people to take pictures by the donut or shoot a music video? Maybe we suggest going to the spot and adding pictures to Google Maps?
- What makes it a success?
- Super important to do something to perpetuate it online
    - The value of doing something in the real world (given that the exposure is not as high as digital world) is the credibility that comes from being in physical, can be re-imported into the physical world
    - Campaign that carries over what is happening in physical world vs metaverse where people care and know what nouns are?
- Can we find something to with the glasses after the fact? They can be stored for future use

**Advertising vs. Other types of Proposals**
- Feedback loops within nouns/NFT is very strong, if we focus only on advertising are we just doing that?
- Naturally the loudest activities will be advertisement, but we want to build as well, not just advertise
- Would like to build things with more substance
- Important to counter balance all the advertising with a larger vision of what is all of this about, what are we doing it all for?
- Should we be thinking about allocation of budget /treasury over time?

**Scaling Treasury / Providing exposure beyond Nouns**
- The tightrope we have to walk is maintaining super high integrity, elevating NFT conversation, while aggregating all of this ETH, which gives us the option to do significant things in the world at scale
- We could offer bonds to whales that want to continue gaining more nouns exposure
- To the extent that nouns continue to be backed by eth, and derive value from ETH, the thing that you‚Äôre buying is the option on scale
- Maybe it's likely with ETH going to 10k or something that noun price is likely to still be 100E or whatever in 2 years
- Would be great to have more ETH, but not at the expense of the culture
- Being able to borrow at anything less than predatory rate limits exposure to eth
- So much asym upside with the potential that those assets could be uncorrelated
- If the end goal is a lot of ETH in the treasury (to do nounish things)
    - Is it possible to get to the scale we want to not doing those things?
    - And start doing those things at scale without impacting the culture?
- Makes me anxious to picture the possibility of liquidation of a friend/dao member
- Increase exposure without increasing their governance exposure seems like a positive culturally

**Building / Funding things that aren‚Äôt visual / art focused**
- How do we fund things that can‚Äôt be easily branded/use Nouns art?
- We can do more things with substance if we dont need to fund visually noun-ish
- We be awesome to have a consistent brand footprint/iconography that eventually spans across web3

1012779455808290946,"MANDATES ROLL-UP:
```
Format: 
Name: tl;dr (link)
  - Honk Critique
```
- Agora: A delegate marketplace lets Nouners signal their funding preference or delegate their votes to others based on alignment of views, leading to more clarity and lower friction for builders to get funded to do valuable things. (https://prop.house/proposal/1023)
  - This requires a lot of engagement from the community to make it actually useful.

- Iris: The Iris protocol ensures availability of comms in case of centralized corporate decisions banning DAOs from Discord. (https://prop.house/proposal/1101)
  - Vague, seems like a decentralization maxi tool that normal people wouldn't use.

- Federation: Allow a Nounish DAO that holds voting power in another Nounish DAO to distribute said voting power amongst all its members. (https://prop.house/proposal/1105)
  - I think this incentivizes Nouns to provide other subDAOs with Nouns and may get subDAO communities more involved in Nouns.

- Nouns on Boardroom: The interface includes a proposal feed, delegate discovery, and a governance facilitator writing content to inform Nouns holders. (https://prop.house/proposal/1140)
  - People who put this on here are anon and I have no way to verify that they have done the past work they said they have.

- heyanoun: phase 1: anyone with a noun can post to a twitter feed. phase 2: anyone with a noun claim discourse badges. (https://prop.house/proposal/1142)
  - This would be a cool experiment, if someone posts racist / political stuff, though, it could tarnish the reputation of the entire DAO.

- The Nouns Proposal Auditor: This app compares proposal line items‚Äô cost with alternatives to ensure they‚Äôre reasonable, and shows a counter offer. (https://prop.house/proposal/1143)
  - The realistic implementation of this tool would fail to take into account context of quality of materials, skill-level of proposers, etc... I don't see it being helpful.

- House of Nouns: A supercharged client for governance, providing discussion and rich context to scale participation. (https://prop.house/proposal/1152)
  - This is a really ambitious project, that would be awesome to see come to fruition - I would be shocked to see it getting delivered for 20ETH. I just really doubt the ability to deliver with such an ambitious project.

- Voting Incentive and Sentiment Voting (on-chain popular vote): Get tokens for voting. (https://prop.house/proposal/1153)
  - I don't see prop builders being willing to give discounts for things based on using these tokens. I also don't see the soul-bound tokens as really having any impact regarding reputation in the DAO.

- Governance Aide & Historian: Human who spends time interviewing voters and helping with governance. (https://prop.house/proposal/1159)
  - People who don't know what to do delegate their nouns, the best thing to help with those who haven't is to provide them with efficient datastream. I feel like this prop is redundant with existing efforts, as well.

- Sybil Resistant Governance by Governor DAO: One-Voice-One-Vote governance modules (democratic, quadratic) for Nouns and broader nounish ecosystem (https://prop.house/proposal/1161)
  - It sounds like we would be funding software that would be integrated into the on-chain voting process? This seems like a big security hole, to me.

934160979028234242,"hi guys.  i want to do a contest ""Nounify the World"" where we encourage creatives of any type to produce any kind of Nouns content - physical or digital, art, memes, with a 10 ETH prize pool.  Anything clever unique or cool but with an emphasis on MEMETIC POTENCY and VIRALITY.  i'd provide examples - golfys gif, memes, physical art, open to other suggestions.  

We'd give 1 ETH to the 3 best and 70+ awards of 0.1 ETH to anything we thought was cool.  it might be worth considering using a L2 for this because of the amount of transactions involved.  The only rules would be no harassment and no vandalism.  I think this could whip twitter into an absolute frenzy.  However, my one concern is that it may be too open ended.  The coloring contest was very successful but it had a much more specific focus.  This would also serve as a trial run for us to work out the kinks before a much, much bigger 2nd run after the super bowl commercial airs

the way i think it'd structure it now would be people quote-retweeting my post for virality and maybe including their ETH address in their tweet.  any kind of tooling to make this easier would be great.  we could assemble a panel of judges for the 3 best and then just spray smaller rewards everywhere somewhat more arbitrarily

- What excites you about CC0 projects like Nouns and where do you see these types of communities going in the future?
- What are your thoughts on NFT utility? Are you building with this in mind?
- What are some things in the space that need to be changed for it to be more successful?
- How can people learn more about you and your project?*

- POAP art for a week 6 individual POAPs for 7 of the Nouns created during NOC
- Participated in voting
- Tweeting
- Re-tweeting 
- Helped 1 or 2 folks by answering their messages on Twitter from the NOC account about what time the show would be on.

This offers so many opportunities in terms of proliferation and collaboration (where you can learn more about in the Discord link above) and I'd love to tell you more about it, but for now what I'd love most is some questions and just receive your thoughts from the video below.

*While I agree that a DAO doesn't necessarily need a ""CEO"" I do think it should have a team of people leading responsibly and following best practices. This is not that. I am 100% in support of running a prop house round but I think we need to set up a multi-sig to store the funds not give them directly to the person who has basically not said a word to the community that he started. If this was a known individual who's reputation was on the line maybe I'd feel differently but this seems irresponsible and risky. 

Please refrain from trying to open the DAO to rug potential in future proposals. It is not fair on people who take security and decentralization seriously. Our funds are in the treasury too. Satori is excited to build with other TraitWorks members except for those who don't follow best practices that all other DAOs follow. Working TOGETHER we can get the job done!*

With the above in mind, I've created a discord for traitworks discussion and will set up some channels and such shortly. We need a place for community discussion rather than making passive aggressive remarks in proposals.

I still need to finish the SDS, but almost everything is already laid out in my noggin. 

I am having a hard time connecting it with the noun esthetic, BUTTT the purpose of the game is use real world scenarios to teach people the basic personal finance and investment skills that school just so happened to bypass.

personally, im very curious to the discourse around them buying a noun. do they buy one? if so, what are their reasons? to propose to the dao? to align with the dao? as an asset? all of the above?

further, interesting to watch: what do they do with the funds? is the cadence too fast? do they get 0 or a ton of proposals? who is proposing? lil nouners or external ppl? who are the buyers? what will they rally around? how do they hash out the ""mission"" (if any) of the dao? etc etc. so much good stuff is to come from simply letting it run for some reasonable amount of time.",

1092514436155199528,"Thank you for the questions!

**1)** 
We consider funds delegated to the Pod to still inherently belong to Nouns. We're responsible for delegation and execution of use. For our first merch drop, we're working with a streetwear-esque supplier https://mf9.store/ to provide quality merch. We regularly receive comments asking for merch, and we expect our first release to sell out quickly. We'll also have our jerseys available for sale via print on demand. As merch production funds have been converted to fiat, and we will be receiving revenue back in fiat, we plan to reinvest all revenue back into producing larger merch quantities for the foreseeable future. Inevitably, we would have no problem providing kickback to Nouns if our merch strategy is sustainable and profitable.

**2)** 
As part of our negotiations with both our CS:GO and Dota Rosters, we did not request any cut of their tournament winnings for this proposal. We made this decision for several reasons. Primarily, it allowed us to significantly reduce the overall cost of the proposal. Additionally, there is some degree of friction with bringing funds back to the DAO due to legal and tax reasons. Furthermore, we believe that taking a significant revenue share from the players is not ideal, given our transparent model. Top teams typically do not take more than 10% (if any) of tournament winnings, and this is seen more as a way to create value-alignment rather than a major revenue driver for orgs. While we would consider a small revenue share back to Nouns in future deals with teams, for our younger organization, we decided to opt out of this arrangement for the current season.

**3) ** 
I look at sustainability in a few ways in the context of the unique intermingling of Nouns and Esports...

Is our project creating bid demand for Nouns? Albeit unclear to quantify, historically, we've already done that and have been attributed for doing so (see my response to Hindsight above).

Can we achieve partnerships or create opportunities worth significant revenue? One of the tournaments we are participating in this coming month will have organization rewards up to $100,000. This is based on social and performance metrics. If our team qualifies for the next stage of the circuit, that team incentive will 3x, up to $300,000. As we continue to cement ourselves as an established brand (many top orgs are decades old while we're still within our first year), we believe partnership inflow will continue to increase. Another partnership example, which I don't want to promise is happening because it's still early, is being paid as an organization to field a roster and compete in a particular game (a very popular FPS). This would also be a six-figure deal, but likely a significant portion is expected to go directly back into investing in the team.

Sponsors? What if Nouns Esports had sponsors other than Nouns? Well, that is something we are pursuing and exploring. We've already been approached by what I would call ""low-hanging fruit"" sponsors, e.g. betting, but what we are really looking for are ideal partners that are culturally aligned with Nouns. For example, Coinbase and Uniswap both sponsor Dota teams, why shouldn't they sponsor the Nouns team? Nouns, due to the art, culture, and technological innovation from the community, is one of the best places to onboard people into crypto. I believe subcommunity efforts, like Esports and Gnars, are the future of onboarding as top-of-funnel tools for Nouns. What if we were also top of funnel onboarding for Base, Coinbase's new L2? Proof of Gamer & That's Gnarly would certainly benefit from lower friction experiences on L2, and Nouns would benefit from Nounish experiences being available on where Coinbase will be driving users.",

Question: **What will happen to your Noun when you die?** What will happen to your crypto in general when you die?

I built a free service to address this inherent problem in the crypto space, which manages digital asset inheritance upon death.

Documentation can be found at https://docs.deathwish1.com/ (with links to dapp and audit)
Mainnet Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x673864a06746b66bcb1b6932108082a37909c145

We should set a regular cadence of meetings (once a week)

4156‚Äôs blog post: Do good in the real world. A chance to make positive change + generate income and inquiry and positive publicity improving the brand value.

Skatepark: It has been great to see so many people putting their hands up and stepping forward to connect us or get involved.

Start with high impact projects: If one is successful we‚Äôll end up with heaps of people/organisations coming at us for nouns to get involved.

How will proposals scale as we grow? Its exciting to imagine what scope of projects will come. 

Donations/contributions that get us to name something is an interesting avenue. 

Skatepark.org accept crypto (awesome!) Do we need a bank account or some sort of real ‚Äútraditional‚Äù world interface to pay for these kind of projects generally? Working on something here.

Incentivising proposal submissions: A pool of money is an incentive itself. Eventually we will be trying to disincentivizing it once it takes off.

Ideally we want noun owners to want to push nouns forward and be active participants, obviously free-rider problem will always exist but could building incentives help and be important? 
-Do we have rewards for voting? 
-Stipends for quality proposal? Incentivise bringing interesting people and ideas to the dao
-Feels too early for above. That should be last resort. Social levers are really powerful.

Coming soon is nouns profile pages! Vote history etc. which will hopefully begin incentivising on a social layer
-Perhaps POAPs and badges for participation will come.

SharkDAO struggling with their own level of participation in voting and proposals etc. One method being used is to try to improve information flow, this could be something nounsDAO should consider.

Should NounsDAO hire some people? There are folks in community interested in working full time as either contractors or employees or residents‚Ä¶ what do we think about that? Scale up resources? Ideas for community management, designer, full stack dev‚Ä¶
-General response positive to this, especially for community and onboarding.",

A) Divide the extra amount equally among all eligible Nouncillors (they must update their Proposals accordingly, or refuse the additional ETH.) 
Pros: Quickness, since we need to execute and report back on these initiatives by end of July. 
Cons: No broader participation, no new ideas. 

B) Ask all Nouncillors who would have been eligible for next round (joined one month too late for eligibility this round) to submit ideas, award top 6 ideas 1 ETH each from remainder. 
Pros: Broader participation, new ideas. 
Cons: Adds 1-2 weeks to administration time, execution timing will be difficult. 

C) Return funds to DAO. 
Pros: Minimal additional work required to administer. 
Cons: Potential optics around appearing as though we cannot deploy capital to good use for proliferation within our networks/communities.

Nounishness is very difficult to define. I did a word study on ‚Äòbeauty‚Äô a while ago, which is also quite difficult to define. In my searching, I found this definition by Jonathan King which I thought hit the nail on the head.

> *Beauty is an intrinsic quality of things which, when it‚Äôs perceived, pleases the mind by a certain kind of fittingness.*

I thought that was a good place to start for describing what Nounish means, which I think is just a certain beauty that is exclusive to Nouns. 

Nounish is an intrinsic quality of things which, when it‚Äôs perceived, pleases the mind by a certain kind of fittingness to the Nouns community. It can be used to describe physical or digital objects and general values.  
*1.    In regards to art: ‚ÄúThat new derivative project looks very Nounish.‚Äù
2.    In regards to physical goods: ‚ÄúEven though it doesn‚Äôt include noggles, this still feels very Nounish to me‚Äù
3.    In regards to values: ‚ÄúKindness and inclusiveness are absolutely Nounish.‚Äù*",

**Here is the Noun Squire form for RFG who has been doing video edits for us this month and modding our discord.**

Noun Squire Contribution Form 

***Special Project I worked on during this period (Aug 15-Sept 14):***
-Noun Square recording/editing (low fats, full recorded episodes before stream)
-After iterating on the format, new short versions will be made for the forseeable, like this: https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1569457731630931968?s=46&t=fDr2Bf3b_WlxzgbIws1wLA
-Discord moderation/community management
-Active FOMO player count watch and reporting

***How many days during this period did I work on the above?***
Daily, sans 3 when I was too sick

***Approximately how many hours per day on those days: ***
2-3 daily on editing, 4 if you count recording prep work/organization.
Community management/moderation is ongoing, whenever I'm in the discord. Primarily during Noun O Clock, to a lesser degree the rest of the time I'm awake.

***Any Highlights of my contributions this period:***
Cleanup compilation video, full length recordings before streams were set up, continued daily involvement as a speaker on the NoC show

***ETH Wallet address: ***

But TLDR for now: Gnars consumes about same gas per auction as Nouns but generally sell for 1/1000th of the price atm. Back to back auctions mean about 8 per day max. 

When gas prices are high this can be quite a lot for a single entity to fund (once precedent is set probably no going back). So for now the emission rate is a product of demand and considering how early we are (less than 2 months) it‚Äôs going pretty well (yet to promote much also). 

At the moment, probably constitutes a UX problem more than an economics problem, so thanks again for the feedback. Since many of these parameters can be changed, i will explore options and as a community we can decide. 

Despite being gnarly, we can take our time and feel it out, make data driven decisions etc. Will be good fun. I think for now, directing newcomers who are met with an unsettled auction to our discord, so we can answer questions is probably a good start. üôè",

And wondering if re-framing the aim is indeed the answer here. 
As <@813421644298321961> said (emphasis by me) ‚Äúa channel *about* women in nouns seems like a better fit than a channel *for* women in nouns, because anyone would be free to participate‚Äù‚Ä®‚Ä®I do think this kind of approach would potentially be even more helpful than creating a ‚Äúgathering place‚Äù anyways right? While avoiding the main negative externality?‚Ä®‚Ä®It makes me think even more about a mission first, channel second‚Ä¶‚Ä®‚Ä®An example:‚Ä®‚Ä®If we can assume/agree that it‚Äôs not ideal that the nouns community is low in female representation, as it is true with NFTs and crypto in general, probably due to a complex mix of reasons stemming from institutional and historical friction and hurdles for women in tech, finance, stem in general etc etc (I dont want to assume expert knowledge here). ‚Ä®But say we do agree to some extent: I see a project like Lil Sisters ‚ÄúA fund created to encourage women and non-binary creators, devs, and artists to build within Lil Nouns.‚Äù And think, OK this is great, its a goal-orientated fund/group/project with a clear mission. It feels nounish to me personally. If something like this (not explicitly the same, necessarily) existed for Nouns and had a channel, that sounds great to me ü§∑. 

The result of something like this is a mission to improve opportunities and representation of X people in Nouns, and so a place to work on it (inclusive). As opposed to a channel for those people to gather (exclusive).‚Ä®‚Ä®https://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/c/lil-sisters/7

You can see filter here https://www.instagram.com/ar/702277330935834/. You might have seen the filter in Sounds-of-Nouns jingles. 

If NounsDAO decides to support this then:
1) I want to use some of the ETH to run community competitions to get more people share photos with AR-glasses on instagram
2) and make snapchat version of the filter.

Any amount of ETH would be appreciated. Many thanks",
1092471872714706974,"**1. Do you have any information about how much other teams are sponsored for?  By who and what they get in return? Some comparable data**

Yes! I have some comparable data on how much other esports teams are sponsored for and what they receive in return. Let's start with Dota as an example. Our team is currently ranked 3rd out of the 16 teams that compete in the Pro Circuit in North America, and we are proposing to pay our players up to $4000 per month.

In comparison, the two teams ranked above us in Dota are Shopify Rebellion and TSM. Shopify Rebellion players, historically one of the most dominant NA teams, are making around $20,000 per month. TSM brought in a new squad consisting of international players from regions across the world and receive between $5000 to $7000 per month.

In South America, the top two teams that we've competed against historically receive $9000 and $12,000 per month, respectively.

In the CS:GO vertical, our players are also receiving up to $4000 per month. The most dominant teams in North America are Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses. Team Liquid is one of the best teams internationally and has a long history in esports. While every player on their team likely makes six figures of salary, star players on independent contracts likely earn upwards of $20-30k per month. Generally speaking all the top teams are making six-figures of salary.

Evil Geniuses is running a unique program in CS:GO with a ""main"" roster and two training squads, ""White"" and ""Black."" Their training rosters earn $5000 per month, while their main roster likely earns double that.

In both game verticals we believe we've identified and are working with teams that fit in a sweet spot of skill, player notoriety, and cost.

So what do these esports orgs get in return?  Attention. They are brands that sell content and association with their content. In Shopify Rebellion's case, they have no additional sponsors, but in the case of teams like Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses, esports native brands, they have a sleeve full of sponsors who pay to be a part of the team's journey.",

Question: **What will happen to your Noun when you die? **What will happen to your crypto in general when you die?

I built a free service to address this inherent problem in the crypto space, which manages digital asset inheritance upon death.

Documentation can be found at https://docs.deathwish1.com/ (with links to dapp and audit)
Mainnet Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/address/0x673864a06746b66bcb1b6932108082a37909c145

I'm writing for access to Nouns DAO funding for this unique use case as well as to encourage Noun holders to use Death Wish to secure their Nouns. I would also appreciate any Tweets in support of my project.

when we look at nouns esports, we have that label as an overarching title but it encompasses multiple people making different proposals for various games/players/activations ect. there is a discord where anyone can join and look to contribute, nouns esport socials will support future other esports prop builders/games ect.

1030126935784816640,"It sounds good on paper, the limiting factor is the people willing to put in that amount of time.  It also creates confusion for people looking for funding (""why this team vs NSFW? With whom am I supposed to talk? Both?"") and redundancy for what Nouners are doing, the latter an issue when attention is scarce and valuable.  It's net fine but I don't think it's particularly additive.  Better for those people to join NSFW and apply that energy and attention there, unless there's a specifically differentiated niche to focus on and then definitely spin up a new one (we have effectively incubated things from NSFW).

In a foresighted view, you see all secondary side effects that stem from the initial reaction. That's what makes bubble a necessity in what concerns the *long* arc of innovation.

Increase in financial value of an asset class > Increased attention from outside world > Inflow of new talent > Trad Media coverage > Increased awareness > Inflow of new talent > .........

Inflow of new talent (which see valid opportunities) vs opportunist (which is the phase we are currently in) is what then spurges the longer trend after the initial bubble popped, as they have a long term view and continue building in this space. That generate new business models based on sustained growth vs hyped growth.",
