903725333595947059,"Was listening to the twitter spaces for 89 and had a thought. There was mention of this dynamic where the majority of auction bids occur right before noun o'clock. I have a feeling that this is a function of the fact that nouns uses a single price, public bid auction. There has been a lot of research into auctions that should produce superior results (defining superior as better price discovery). 

Has anyone thought about researching / potentially integrating a different auction method (ex: generalized second price auction,VCG auction, etc. ) ?",1

1047017382419382363,"Looking for some feedback on this DAO. 

Idea is a network state based on collecting/curation and scholarship around xcopy (I know, but hear me out) 

I can‚Äôt work about a better name than xcopyology, xcopystan, xcopy land or something like that

Xcopy has a tumblr archive dating back 12 years containing 1200 works or thereabouts. It‚Äôs a great resource that documents his development and process and obviously as a collector I look at it an go, well what if tumblr died, how can this be preserved? 

To build an on chain record of this work is the aim (and remembering xcopy work is cc0) 

So I have downloaded all the works chronologically. The files are webp but I have gifs and png files also. Most of the works are between 4 and 8 frames for the webp. 

Was thinking a daily auction of each work, which is original xcopy first brought onchain, and therefore valuable as a 1/1, then using the funds to buy onchain xcopy works and create an atlas/compendium and scholarly curation work on mirror. 

At the end of the auction period all the collected works would be donated to a museum that agrees to show the work in public 

Q: it will work better if the uploaded files are gif or webp. Any way to do that? 
Q: obvs the files are just one layer but I wonder about layering each frame of the 8 frames into groups for each work. Not sure I can do that 
Q: the files are a fraction under 600 pixels, so I have to resize all 1200 unless nouns.build can be tweaked to allow smaller file sizes?

I'd propose that we give to 5 charities, we do the work to think about ones that best match our collective priorities as a DAO (Im in the bag for the memetic consistency of at least one that focused on children's literacy, but there's digital rights focused ones that also make sense), and keep it simple.

Anything clever unique or cool but with an emphasis on MEMETIC POTENCY and VIRALITY.  i'd provide examples - golfys gif, memes, physical art, open to other suggestions.  

We'd give 1 ETH to the 3 best and 70+ awards of 0.1 ETH to anything we thought was cool.  it might be worth considering using a L2 for this because of the amount of transactions involved.  The only rules would be no harassment and no vandalism.  I think this could whip twitter into an absolute frenzy.  However, my one concern is that it may be too open ended.  The coloring contest was very successful but it had a much more specific focus.  This would also serve as a trial run for us to work out the kinks before a much, much bigger 2nd run after the super bowl commercial airs

the way i think it'd structure it now would be people quote-retweeting my post for virality and maybe including their ETH address in their tweet.  any kind of tooling to make this easier would be great.  we could assemble a panel of judges for the 3 best and then just spray smaller rewards everywhere somewhat more arbitrarily

It just so happened to bring the prototype with me on my little excursion to Mexico. When I came across Nouns I got fucking hyped and pulled out ol√© faithful.

I still need to finish the SDS, but almost everything is already laid out in my noggin. 

I am having a hard time connecting it with the noun esthetic, BUTTT the purpose of the game is use real world scenarios to teach people the basic personal finance and investment skills that school just so happened to bypass. I am hoping with this game I could help people free themselves from the cyclic path of financial struggle. To me that's pretty dang nounish.

Would love to collab with some others to help me with the coding and final design.

I'm writing for access to Nouns DAO funding for this unique use case as well as to encourage Noun holders to use Death Wish to secure their Nouns. I would also appreciate any Tweets in support of my project.

Thanks for reading!",1

We should set a regular cadence of meetings (once a week)

4156‚Äôs blog post: Do good in the real world. A chance to make positive change + generate income and inquiry and positive publicity improving the brand value.

Skatepark: It has been great to see so many people putting their hands up and stepping forward to connect us or get involved.

Start with high impact projects: If one is successful we‚Äôll end up with heaps of people/organisations coming at us for nouns to get involved.

How will proposals scale as we grow? Its exciting to imagine what scope of projects will come. 

Donations/contributions that get us to name something is an interesting avenue. 

Skatepark.org accept crypto (awesome!) Do we need a bank account or some sort of real ‚Äútraditional‚Äù world interface to pay for these kind of projects generally? Working on something here.

Incentivising proposal submissions: A pool of money is an incentive itself. Eventually we will be trying to disincentivizing it once it takes off.

Ideally we want noun owners to want to push nouns forward and be active participants, obviously free-rider problem will always exist but could building incentives help and be important? 
-Do we have rewards for voting? 
-Stipends for quality proposal? Incentivise bringing interesting people and ideas to the dao
-Feels too early for above. That should be last resort. Social levers are really powerful.

Coming soon is nouns profile pages! Vote history etc. which will hopefully begin incentivising on a social layer
-Perhaps POAPs and badges for participation will come.

SharkDAO struggling with their own level of participation in voting and proposals etc. One method being used is to try to improve information flow, this could be something nounsDAO should consider.

Should NounsDAO hire some people? There are folks in community interested in working full time as either contractors or employees or residents‚Ä¶ what do we think about that? Scale up resources? Ideas for community management, designer, full stack dev‚Ä¶
-General response positive to this, especially for community and onboarding.",1

A) Divide the extra amount equally among all eligible Nouncillors (they must update their Proposals accordingly, or refuse the additional ETH.) 
Pros: Quickness, since we need to execute and report back on these initiatives by end of July. 
Cons: No broader participation, no new ideas. 

B) Ask all Nouncillors who would have been eligible for next round (joined one month too late for eligibility this round) to submit ideas, award top 6 ideas 1 ETH each from remainder. 
Pros: Broader participation, new ideas. 
Cons: Adds 1-2 weeks to administration time, execution timing will be difficult. 

C) Return funds to DAO. 
Pros: Minimal additional work required to administer. 
Cons: Potential optics around appearing as though we cannot deploy capital to good use for proliferation within our networks/communities.

Nounishness is very difficult to define. I did a word study on ‚Äòbeauty‚Äô a while ago, which is also quite difficult to define. In my searching, I found this definition by Jonathan King which I thought hit the nail on the head.

> *Beauty is an intrinsic quality of things which, when it‚Äôs perceived, pleases the mind by a certain kind of fittingness.*

I thought that was a good place to start for describing what Nounish means, which I think is just a certain beauty that is exclusive to Nouns. 

Nounish is an intrinsic quality of things which, when it‚Äôs perceived, pleases the mind by a certain kind of fittingness to the Nouns community. It can be used to describe physical or digital objects and general values.  
*1.    In regards to art: ‚ÄúThat new derivative project looks very Nounish.‚Äù
2.    In regards to physical goods: ‚ÄúEven though it doesn‚Äôt include noggles, this still feels very Nounish to me‚Äù

But TLDR for now: Gnars consumes about same gas per auction as Nouns but generally sell for 1/1000th of the price atm. Back to back auctions mean about 8 per day max. 

When gas prices are high this can be quite a lot for a single entity to fund (once precedent is set probably no going back). So for now the emission rate is a product of demand and considering how early we are (less than 2 months) it‚Äôs going pretty well (yet to promote much also). 

At the moment, probably constitutes a UX problem more than an economics problem, so thanks again for the feedback. Since many of these parameters can be changed, i will explore options and as a community we can decide. 

Despite being gnarly, we can take our time and feel it out, make data driven decisions etc. Will be good fun. I think for now, directing newcomers who are met with an unsettled auction to our discord, so we can answer questions is probably a good start. üôè",1

1092471872714706974,"**1. Do you have any information about how much other teams are sponsored for?  By who and what they get in return? Some comparable data**

Yes! I have some comparable data on how much other esports teams are sponsored for and what they receive in return. Let's start with Dota as an example. Our team is currently ranked 3rd out of the 16 teams that compete in the Pro Circuit in North America, and we are proposing to pay our players up to $4000 per month.

In comparison, the two teams ranked above us in Dota are Shopify Rebellion and TSM. Shopify Rebellion players, historically one of the most dominant NA teams, are making around $20,000 per month. TSM brought in a new squad consisting of international players from regions across the world and receive between $5000 to $7000 per month.

In South America, the top two teams that we've competed against historically receive $9000 and $12,000 per month, respectively.

In the CS:GO vertical, our players are also receiving up to $4000 per month. The most dominant teams in North America are Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses. Team Liquid is one of the best teams internationally and has a long history in esports. While every player on their team likely makes six figures of salary, star players on independent contracts likely earn upwards of $20-30k per month. Generally speaking all the top teams are making six-figures of salary.

Evil Geniuses is running a unique program in CS:GO with a ""main"" roster and two training squads, ""White"" and ""Black."" Their training rosters earn $5000 per month, while their main roster likely earns double that.

In both game verticals we believe we've identified and are working with teams that fit in a sweet spot of skill, player notoriety, and cost.

So what do these esports orgs get in return?  Attention. They are brands that sell content and association with their content. In Shopify Rebellion's case, they have no additional sponsors, but in the case of teams like Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses, esports native brands, they have a sleeve full of sponsors who pay to be a part of the team's journey.",1

when we look at nouns esports, we have that label as an overarching title but it encompasses multiple people making different proposals for various games/players/activations ect. there is a discord where anyone can join and look to contribute, nouns esport socials will support future other esports prop builders/games ect.

Better for those people to join NSFW and apply that energy and attention there, unless there's a specifically differentiated niche to focus on and then definitely spin up a new one (we have effectively incubated things from NSFW).

Even at ~100 ETH a day, we're bringing in ~600 ETH ($2.7M) a week. What are we spending a week? I don't know exactly, but something very very little in comparison. As an experimental, early project, why are we so interested in stockpiling ETH? To prepare for a winter? Because we are worried the nouns auction price would drop in the future and this is all we'll ever have? I think the only reason such a drought of buyers would occur (maybe we're starting to see it now) is if this group fails to demonstrate that it can spend the treasury in an inspiring way. The first set of buyers (~100 of us so far) were people that were just excited about the set of primitives (daily auction + treasury + governance) and were willing to fill in the blank space about what this could be. I think there's a limit to that pure-imagination crowd. The next set of buyers need to be inspired by what we do with the ETH we have. Failing to spend (and as a result failing to inspire) is the failure state we need to proactively avoid.",1
