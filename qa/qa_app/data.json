    "question": "I've been reading a lot into DAOs and heard about snapshot. Anyone know why nouns does not use Snapshot.org for governance ? Could it be possible to migrate the governance to snapshot. I'm wondering how snapshot can trigger transactions though",
    "answer_qa2": "Nouns does not use Snapshot.org for governance because Nouns is focused on on-chain governance. Snapshot is off-chain, which is less secure than on-chain governance. It is possible to migrate governance to Snapshot, but it would not be as secure as the current on-chain system. Snapshot can trigger transactions using tools like the Zodiac Reality module, but it still has issues with accurately getting transactions on-chain.",
    "answer_gpt3": "Yes, the question was answered. ShinyZero#0557 replied to Vad#0632's question by saying that they use Snapshot for voting and reality.eth + snapsafe for on-chain execution. However, they also mentioned that it's not as secure as full onchain. Benbodhi#1111 also provided additional information on how snapshot can execute transactions by suggesting to check out the zodiac reality module.",

I'm exploring the use of SVGs, fully on-chain art and some possible Noun ideas, and wondered what was the reason for the 320x320px for Nouns? I know a project using vectors/SVGs could be something like 24x24px and rendered/scaled higher as an alternative. I usually work with raster images, and i'm trying to understand what is considered 'best practice' for fully on-chain projects. Thanks.",

I know there is a view within the dao at times that think we shouldn\u2019t spend our time thinking about things like liquidity since that\u2019s just finance things not creating real long term value. but an asset that has more liquidity is more valuable. I would bid for a noun today at a higher price if I knew there was 10x the liquidity we have right now around the floor (there is some for sure on OS but it\u2019s not super liquid). a higher price for noun auctions now is more treasury for the DAO and a stronger financial position to fund all nounish things into the future (like fund prop house more aggressively). I haven\u2019t seen a better solution than this and feel excited by what it could be. thanks for the draft proposal <@!163869297318428673>!",

    "answer_qa2": "Yes, there is a way for the swap and send to be triggered by the searchers so that a naive nouner or builder doesn't need to do anything except watch the funds get converted and transferred. The idea discussed involves allowing the searcher to pay through a priority queue, passing the funds through one of the DAO's contracts for accounting purposes, and then having the funds flow to the builder. This would involve paying out outstanding debt before topping up the reserve.",
    "answer_gpt3": "Yes, the question was answered. The conversation suggests that it is possible for the swap and send to be triggered by the searchers, and the funds can be converted and transferred without the need for a naive nouner or builder to do anything except watch. The idea of allowing the searcher to pay through a priority queue was discussed, and it was suggested that the searcher could transfer tokens directly to the builder, with the funds flowing to the builder after passing through one of their contracts for accounting purposes. However, it was also mentioned that this may require more gas for the searcher.",

          "content": "This guide will walk you through the steps of creating a Nouns DAO proposal. If you're unsure whether a proposal is the correct path for your idea to receive funding, please refer to this guide to ensure you're in the right place. If your idea is still in a nascent stage or the details haven't been fleshed out, you can get feedback in the <#875751366340005908> channel in the Nouns Discord.\n\n**How To Write A Proposal**\nYour proposal should communicate:\n- What is the project\n- How will it proliferate Nouns\n- How much funding do you need\n- How will the funds be used\n\nWe advise keeping this information at the top of your proposal, potentially as a TL;DR section. Submissions can quickly become quite long as implementation details are fleshed out, and readers will appreciate having this baseline info summarized up-front. It's in your interest to make the proposal easy to digest and get the gist of in seconds.\n\nBelow you'll find three well-rounded proposals that were successfully funded. They clearly communicated their idea with a simple overview, a timeline with milestones, and a cost breakdown.\n\n**Post On Discourse**\nOnce you have all the details nailed down, you can post your proposal on the Nouns Discourse, a forum for longer-form proposal ideas. At the top, click the \"+ New Topic\" button and post your idea. Be sure to prefix the title with \"Proposal: \"to be easily identified as a proposal request. \n\nNow, fill in your content in the text field, including images. Feel free to save your progress and come back later. \n\n*(Please note that Discourse doesn't give editing privileges to new accounts until they've been active for a while, so if you make a mistake or typo in your proposal, you won't be able to change it. Instead, you can specify in the comments what was wrong.)*\n\n**Sponsorship**\nOnly Noun owners (Nouners) can submit official proposals to the DAO for funding. If you don't own a Noun, you'll have to get a sponsor to put the proposal on-chain for you. You can connect with a sponsor by waiting for feedback on your Discourse post or via networking in the Discord. You can also try to get groups like The Nouncil or any of the Nouns' SubDAOs to sponsor your proposal.\n\n**Getting Feedback**\nThis is the refinement phase. All proposals undergo budget and impact scrutiny, so don't be surprised if yours is too. The \"refining fire\" prepares your proposal for the voting period. This phase will help make sure your proposal is in great shape and won't be defeated for something that could've been easily avoided.\n\nIt's common to face push-back at this stage of the proposal, and we ask you to take criticism in stride. The goal is to make sure proposals effectively proliferate Nouns, and we want you to succeed.\n\n**Voting Timeline**\nOnce your proposal is submitted, it will enter the Voting Week, which lasts for a minimum of seven days. When the proposal goes on-chain, its status will receive a 'pending' status. This is a 2-day window where proposals are public but cannot be voted on. Usually, the proposal attracts more attention at this point and is heavily discussed on Discord. \n\nNext, the status will change to 'active', and Noun holders can vote on it for the next three days. When the 'active' period ends, the proposal will either have succeeded or been defeated (barring cancellation or a veto). \n\nIf the proposal succeeds, it will have to be manually queued for execution. This is done by connecting your wallet to nouns.wtf/vote, finding the prop, and clicking the \"Queue Proposal \u2310\u25e8-\u25e8\" button. Anyone can do this step, and there is a gas fee attached. When done, the status will be changed to 'queued', and after another two days of waiting, the proposal will be executed. Your proposal has been passed, and the building can begin!",

The artistic flow of the different collections, highlights the colourful and playful nature of what it means to be Nounish. \n\nThe museum aims to become a beacon to encourage other creative minds into the Nouns ecosystem, to onboard people into Nouns through a visual journey  and ultimately to share what Nouns are with broader audiences. \n\nCurating the first exhibition has been a blast but more than that it has been a journey of discovery that has opened my eyes to the many different Nouns derivatives and artists within the ecosystem. The amount of creativity, talent and dedication around Nouns is unparalleled.\n\nOur first exhibition is now live, this has been a project of love, passion and dedication; from creating the Voxel model for the building, to curating the first exhibition and creating the website, it has been an amazing journey that I feel incredibly proud of. \n\nWebsite: https://thenounsmuseum.wtf/\nCryptovoxels: https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=W@6477W,109N\nTwitter: @thenounsmuseum (edited)\nhttps://twitter.com/TortitaTrades/status/1532058349864353792?s=20&t=RBuGbj1L2_HSYDo0NlDnlA\n\nhttps://twitter.com/thenounsmuseum/status/1532077310957875200?s=20&t=QnYIHw8X2iW10MtAVYrEDA",

Settlement is not time-bound, and someone just has to trigger the transaction to settle. The settlement can be executed next block or next week if no one calls the function. Anyone can settle, often the winner. Settle is basically simply saying the auction is completed.",

          "content": "A long time ago, I thought to start a company to train pets. Today, I think it is possible to use reinforcement learning and all available technologies to teach dogs/cats to speak or express in human-like language. When I joined this channel I though the idea to make such an app could fit so well with nouns. The pets can be nouns mascots. The startup will teach pets to recognize noun words. The impact would be so meaningful and generate lots of interest from press. I think there are infinitely many opportunities for such an idea.\n\nFor example, a first step could be a computer vision app to monitor dogs behavior and a video streaming app that feeds training information to dogs. This will allow us to quickly train dogs to remember words and associate objects. We can teach them to memorize nouns for example!\nNext, we can use signal processing to analyze and recognize barks and extract meaningful features such as voice pitch, tempo etc. Using that data we can attempt to design a language that would be intuitive and easy to remember for pets. Example, the binary bark language would be easy to implement but hard to remember for dogs or humans.\nThe final step is to create a bark2english application that would allow us to translate commands into bark language, and vise versa. A command given in bark language would be better perceived by the pets and allow us to teach them phrases and sentences with a goal that someday the pets can talk to each other\n\nI will share more info if anyone interested",

They also explained that the person who made the large bid jump likely wanted the Noun badly and knew that if they only bid 1 ETH higher, they would be outbid. Additionally, they wanted to avoid paying gas fees multiple times, so they made a significant jump in their bid.",
    "answer_gpt3": "Yes, the question was answered. The high demand for Nouns is the reason why the bids for Nouns are in the 1-4 eth range and jump up 10-20x in the next bid.",

    "question": "Hello Nouners! Question from a non-technical fan here.\n\nI would love to try to mint an off-chain noun I generate in the playground to main net myself, and store the art on chain the same way that Nouns do. Hopefully it would be a fun learning process for me.\n\nDoes anyone know of a high quality guide that could help? I have found a lot of so-so guides online, and the guide on minting an NFT at the Ethereum foundation seems to suggest hosting art on IPFS.\n\nSorry if this isn't the right place to ask! Huge fan of the project, the meme, and the art!",

    "question": "Two ways to interpret this:\n\n1. Are you insinuating bids 6 through n can claim? I think there were some strong objections to this during the proposal phase because it would be easy to exploit.\n\n2. Once a POAP is airdropped, would there be a need to claim again? We don\u2019t have plans to allow multiple POAPs to be claimed by one wallet.\n\nAlso, the challenge with the current state of Web3 wallets is there isn\u2019t a way to send notifications. The convenience of airdropping bypasses the need to notify.",
    "answer_qa2": "The question was whether bids 6 through n can claim POAPs and if there would be a need to claim again once a POAP is airdropped. The answers provided in the direct reply are:\n\n1. The initial idea was for the top 10 bidders (top 5 = airdrop, 6-10 = claim), but after revisiting the proposal, it was agreed to restrict it to the top 5 bidders.\n2. There wouldn't be a need to claim again if the user is airdropped a POAP.",
    "answer_gpt3": "Yes, the question was answered. The user 0xdesigner#3883 asked two questions related to the Nouns Bidder POAP project. The first question was whether bids 6 through n can claim the POAP, and the second question was whether there would be a need to claim again once a POAP is airdropped. skilift.eth#0785 directly replied to the user's questions and answered both of them. They stated that they had top 10 in mind, so top 5 would be airdropped, and 6-10 would be claimed. They also mentioned that there would be no need to claim again if the user is airdropped.",

I had top 10 in my mind (so top 5 = airdrop, 6-10 = claim), but going back through Discourse, I see the arguments for restricting to top 5 and I agree with them.\n\n2.) I don't think there'd be a need to claim again if the user is airdropped.\n\nRegarding the notifications, I think having a little button/notification on the UI that showed there was something waiting to be claimed works well. Kind of like how projects did airdropped tokens (like UNI with Uniswap), once a qualifying wallet connected to the UI, a special button was present indicating there was something to claim.",

Those are as follows:\n\n<@!816727974485164062>  | Will explore ~30+ different Nounish Being body types and combinations, as well as explore a wide range of color combinations. We are starting wide, and as we're ready to narrow them down, we will share options with the community here to get their opinion.\n\n<@!827964581850513408>  | Will start the project out by conducting a narrative + user journey exploration as well as pull together an initial moodboard for how we envision the microsite coming to life.\n\n<@!410593947027505162>  | Will work alongside brkfstsndwch to conduct further research into the POAP API to find ways in which we can make the claiming function as seamless as possible for all users.\n\n<@!620406459913469955>  | Will work with Christian on the POAP API research, as well as begin working on marketing and communication plans for how to bring awareness to the Nouns Bidder POAPs.",

We would love your feedback, notes, any initial thoughts you have. So share away!\n- With those notes, David will then work on adjusting the Nounish Beings to fit within the constraints of the POAP system's file requirements.\n\n**Bidder User Journey**\n**Trigger**\nThe Trigger function in the user journey is where we have a few questions we'd like to propose to the Nouns Community in order to gather a preferred consensus. There are two ways to go about the trigger/receiving process with the end result of holding the Bidder POAP. View those below:\n        \n1. You can use the microsite to claim your own POAP and go through the poap.xyz ecosystem through our microsite. \n       \n 2. We can claim the POAP for the Bidder \"Winners\" and have the POAP sent to them within the poap.xyz ecosystem. If we were to go this route, we would end up creating a microsite that is more of a playground for people to explore what this POAP and the Nounish Beings are all about. Think, more information on Nouns, David, the proliferation of the community, fun features to explore different POAPs etc. \n \nBeyond those two options for the trigger/receipt function, we have a larger question for the Nouns Community. Read below:\n\n- In order to bring awareness to this microsite and the ability to claim, for free a Nouns Bidder POAP, would the DAO be open to allowing the addition of a link within the main nav or footer that would then send people to our microsite to be able to let bidders know they have this free gift that they get to claim? And also allow people just explore and learn more while waiting for auctions to end, etc.\n \n----------------------------  \n We would love any and all thoughts on the initial question of the trigger as well as thoughts on the proposition of an additional link on the site for the POAP function. \n    \n\n**Next Steps**\n<@!827964581850513408> | Creation of initial moodboard for site style\n<@!816727974485164062> | Updates and refinements of the Nounish Beings\n<@!620406459913469955> | Come to a consensus on the backend claiming or aridropping function for the POAPs",

I had top 10 in my mind (so top 5 = airdrop, 6-10 = claim), but going back through Discourse, I see the arguments for restricting to top 5 and I agree with them.\n\n2.) I don't think there'd be a need to claim again if the user is airdropped.\n\nRegarding the notifications, I think having a little button/notification on the UI that showed there was something waiting to be claimed works well. Kind of like how projects did airdropped tokens (like UNI with Uniswap), once a qualifying wallet connected to the UI, a special button was present indicating there was something to claim.",

          "content": "Thanks for the write-up!\n\nIt's my understanding that POAPs are free for the issuer (I assume poap.xyz subsidizes the gas?), so airdropping seems like a good solution to make sure no one misses out. I don't personally share the association of airdrops with spam. \n\nIf POAP ever decides to cease the subsidy (assuming that's how it works), then I think the secondary solution makes more sense. There could be something that shows \"hey you're the top bid! if you're a top 5 bidder at the auction end, you earn a POAP!\" If that's communicated right when the bid is placed, I think that addresses the 'awareness' aspect. It'd just be up to them to check back at the end.",

Or would you like to use an existing folder of your own?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s pull heads from nouns, gnars, jims and toadz, bodies from the same, but also add my folder called \u2018bodies ready to go\u2019 that\u2019s in my working folder\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd backgrounds ser?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s use 10% each of the top 10 CCO collections by auction sale price for the month of October 2023, I like the Halloween themes, but make sure there\u2019s no more than 10% Halloween related\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you like to use the NounsDAO noggles?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah let\u2019s use all the single colour frames only and add the GnarsDAO version too\u201d\n\n\u201cAny other traits or additions to the artwork?\u201d\n\n\u201cActually yeah, can you find that one head I made about 6 months ago? It was a tree stump with an axe in it\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. And what about auction frequency? Would you like to base it on minutes, hours, days or blocks?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this one should be every 3 hours without buffer, when time is up, auction should end\u201d\n\n\u201cOk. Would you like a complete fork with treasury and governance set up with all new wallets!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, perfect! And make the multi sig a 4 of 8 with the usual crew please, then alert them when they have a new wallet to accept\u201d\n\n\u201cOk great! You\u2019re almost set, just need to pick a colour scheme for the frontend unless you\u2019re doing a contract only, stealth launch again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with the charcoal dark theme with purple and green neon accents for this\u201d\n\n\u201cLast step, what will we call this DAO?\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it BlastFromThePastDAO and the tokens will be labelled TTRAVEL\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, that\u2019s everything! I\u2019ve deployed this to 3 testnets and I ran simultaneous hyper speed rigour tests for 2500 years, all looks good, would you like to launch to main net now or schedule launch?\u201d\n\n\u201cSchedule for 4:20pm UTC on the 6/9/2027 please\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got it! That\u2019s scheduled for almost a month from now. Would you like me to setup socials and community applications under the same names?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes please and can you run an awareness campaign in the lead up please? Language tone should be fun, playful and knowledgeable.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat, we\u2019re all set, your fork is ready to go, good luck, have fun!\u201d\n\n\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8",

I wished it was already available haha.\n\nI have a Nounish project coming up, the smart contract (functions are a bit different from your standard Noun contract) is almost finished, but I just need to find someone to help with me the front-end/website, so we can launch ASAP.\n\n<@860360610066595860> was kind enough to link me to <@881315476163141642> & <@884627530919870514>, who agreed to fund this project through a small grant. \nCan't tell much more publicly right now, all I can tell is that it's going to be something very new and might create a precedent in the artistic space. \n\nAnyone with experience in creating Nounish websites would be happy to help me with the front end?\nAlso looking for someone to audit the contract \ud83d\ude4f \n\nThank you!",

    "question": "Hey guys, I have been experimenting with proxies and trying to redeploy the Auctionhouse and AuctionHouseProxy, but I can't connect the AuctionHouseProxy to the AuctionHouse. \n\nAt first, when initializing the AuctionHouseProxy contract, I thought you were running the `initialize()` function from the deployment and that was the `data` field from this constructor : \n\n```contract NounsAuctionHouseProxy is TransparentUpgradeableProxy {\n    constructor(\n        address logic,\n        address admin,\n        bytes memory data\n    ) TransparentUpgradeableProxy(logic, admin, data) {}\n}```\n\nBut after scratching my head for a few hours, it just doesn't work, probably because the context isn't the right one and the `initialize()`  function should be called somewhere else. May I ask what should be set here in order to redeploy it successfully ?",

I wished it was already available haha.\n\nI have a Nounish project coming up, the smart contract (functions are a bit different from your standard Noun contract) is almost finished, but I just need to find someone to help with me the front-end/website, so we can launch ASAP.\n\n<@860360610066595860> was kind enough to link me to <@881315476163141642> & <@884627530919870514>, who agreed to fund this project through a small grant. \nCan't tell much more publicly right now, all I can tell is that it's going to be something very new and might create a precedent in the artistic space. \n\nAnyone with experience in creating Nounish websites would be happy to help me with the front end?\nAlso looking for someone to audit the contract \ud83d\ude4f \n\nThank you!",

For instance SharkDAO and Noun Punks. If we allowed multiple people per project they might want even more people involved, like maybe 3-10 people.",

Please check out the updated site and share your feedback! \n\nAs with the prior testing cycling, instructions can be found here: https://devloper.notion.site/Nouns-Party-Launch-Deetz-e5537a9a65ed4ea7854b74b5fe0b5d83\n\nSeveral big changes:\n1. Completely revamped the claim, withdraw and settle flows. It now happens much more intuitively. When a historic auction is won, simply click back and select settle. Other syncing happens inline.\n2. Withdrawal is now much less limited. Users can withdraw as long as they're not in an active auction. \n3. Updated the UI to better group the information\n4. Nounified the cursors and added hide/show\n5. Improved the fonts and layouts and favicon\n\nWith that said, we feel ready to launch at 10AM PST!  We are still adding some finishing touches to copy and UI, but it feels very close!",

The project progress was so good, for example, we finished the Artwork(5k nfts) and almost finished the front-end website too. But before a few days ago, the founder had personal issues and he was pulling out from the project. \nI took over the project and worked like a crazy boy as a front-end developer & contract developer & backend developer and shiller and also moderator. \nBut the project state is a Hold-on state because of not enough investment.\nI'm currently looking for new projects that I can jump into and also inviting new investors who have an interest in my previous project.(If you have interested, please contact me).\nIf you have some problems in blockchain technology, feel free to ask me and hire me.",

          "content": "Hi everyone! Perhaps this question has been answered and addressed before, but I was wondering if there is a risk that the Nouns DAO is offering \"securities\" by its sale of Nouns. I don't want to incite FUD and I realize that there is probably no clear answer, but given my background in law, I just wanted to make sure. There have been some enforcement actions by the SEC against a few ICOs for unregistered securities offerings but not for NFTs; I do not believe NFTs are necessarily immune from SEC enforcement as many NFTs are increasingly starting to resemble securities (e.g. promise of royalties, profits, etc.) and the SEC has not been entirely logically consistent in their analyses. The SEC and the court (in the US) has applied the Howey Test to determine whether something constitutes a security, and I was concerned some critical prongs of the test may be triggered given the structure and some features of the Nouns DAO (i.e. treasury; Nounders leading the project, etc.). If this question/risk has been addressed before, can someone point to the relevant discussion and/or findings? Thank you!",

    "answer_qa2": "The reason to have the option to \"super-abstain\" in the nouncil vote is to differentiate between two types of abstentions. As explained by fiveoceans_dev#5450, when there was only one abstain emoji vote, it was ambiguous whether the nouncil abstained due to a conflict of interest, lack of time to read the proposal, or if they wanted to cast an abstain vote on-chain. The \u274c vote means that the nouncil member is present but doesn't have time to read the proposal or make a decision, while the \ud83c\udde6 vote implies that the nouncil should vote abstain on-chain.",
    "answer_gpt3": "Yes, the question was answered. The reason to have the option to \"super-abstain\" in the nouncil vote is that some people might not have time to read a proposal and make their decision but also don't want to miss a vote because it affects their vote participation rate. So they can vote \u274c meaning they are present. Then \ud83c\udde6 vote implies that nouncil should vote abstain on-chain.",

Our number one goal is to improve governance efficacy\n2. We believe the most direct way to do that is to increase delegation, which is what we'll do in the next 3 months, and why we're asking for the funding.\n3. using this funding, we will invest in 3 areas that we believe will drive delegation the most: continued investment in the agora app, direct outreach to nouners, and rewarding positive behaviours\n4.  the latter is left intentionally open ended because although we strongly believe in rewards being a powerful lever, but also that a badly design reward can do more harm than good, so our intent is to run small scale experiments first \u2013\u00a0such as creating a bounty program to get inactive nouners to delegate",

    "answer_qa2": "There is no clear answer to what qualifies as a \"derivative\" project. It's a spectrum, and the distinction between \"derivative\" and \"inspired by\" can be subjective. Some suggestions from the conversation include separating projects into categories like art-inspired derivatives, code-inspired derivatives, and forks. Another idea is to track specific details, such as projects using Nouns glasses or projects that are entire forks of Nouns DAO. However, there is no definitive answer, and drawing a line between what is considered a derivative and what is not can be challenging.",
    "answer_gpt3": "The question asked by cdt#3727 was: \"What qualifies as a 'derivative' project?\" The conversation includes some direct replies to the question, such as JoelCares#5898 suggesting that it could be useful to separate art-inspired derivatives from code-inspired derivatives and that it would involve subjective gatekeeping work by someone. brkfstsndwch#6874 also replied that they wouldn't call their project a derivative, but rather a project that pulled inspiration from Nouns. However, there is no clear answer to the question, and Messhup#0001 stated that there is no correct answer, and if there was, it could add a \"gatekeeping\" component. Therefore, the question was discussed, but there is no clear answer provided.",
