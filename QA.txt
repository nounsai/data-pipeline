Q&A table

Objective:

Create table that has curated questions/answers from the old Nouns legacy db. The table should contain
the following columns:

1. UUID because why not
2. discord_message_id from the original question in legacy_chatlogs
3. answer generated by GPT-3
4. model used to generate answer
5. timestamps

We will only add questions here that GPT-3 was able to respond with, meaning if GPT-3 does not have a response we will not record a record. we can query for this information.

Procedure for first procurement of questions:

- Develop a prompt that will identify the following (all prompts will be logged and stored for review):
  - is the content an actual question?
  - is the question related to that of Nouns DAO?
  - if not, skip
  - if yes, proceed to next step: (first pass let's record all of the ones that pass into the qa db)
    - capture the next 50 messages that occurred in the discord after the question was above was asked.
    - create a prompt (we already have this) that will ask GPT-3 to autocomplete the answer to the question
      based on context provided. an answer might not be available.
      - if an answer is not available, record the question to the database without answer. we can
        later revisit this by querying all unanswered by relevant questions to see if they can be backfilled.
        any clients will only query questions where the answer is not null
      - if an answer is available, update the database with it.
